Over the course of 24 hours, my team and I explored information regarding violations(corporate crime and misconduct) and subsidies(government financial assisstance to business).
The Data is provided by GoodJobsFirst, from their website, " a national policy resource center that promotes corporate and government accountability in economic development."
They are a nonprofit commercial watchdog based in Washington, D.C. 

Please explore and use these findings at your leisure. Allow your curiousity to roam free.
Thank you to GoodJobsFirst for the data, LMU ISBA for the thon, and Sophia & Will for the fun win!
